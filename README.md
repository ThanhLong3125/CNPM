# Project Architecture Overview

This project is a modern web application built with a decoupled client-server architecture. The frontend is a Single-Page Application (SPA) and communicates with a separate backend API.

## Backend (.NET Web API)

The backend is an ASP.NET Core Web API written in C#. It follows a layered or N-tier architecture, promoting separation of concerns and maintainability.

-   **Technology Stack:** C#, ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core
-   **Database:** The use of Entity Framework Core and a `Migrations` folder suggests a relational database (e.g., SQL Server, PostgreSQL, SQLite).

### Key Architectural Layers & Directories:

-   **/Controllers:** Defines the API endpoints (e.g., `AuthController`, `DoctorController`). These handle incoming HTTP requests, validate input (often using DTOs), and delegate the business logic to the service layer.

-   **/Services:** This layer contains the core business logic of the application. Services like `DoctorService` and `AuthService` are responsible for orchestrating operations, processing data, and interacting with the data access layer.

-   **/Data:** Contains the `AppDbContext.cs`, which is the Entity Framework Core database context. It acts as the bridge between the application's domain models and the database, handling all data querying and persistence.

-   **/Models:** Defines the core domain entities (e.g., `Patient`, `User`, `MedicalRecord`). These C# classes map directly to the database tables.

-   **/DTOs (Data Transfer Objects):** These are plain C# classes used to shape the data that is sent to and from the API endpoints. They help prevent issues like over-posting and separate the API's public contract from the internal database models.

-   **/Migrations:** Contains database migration files generated by Entity Framework Core. These track incremental changes to the database schema.

-   **/wwwroot/images:** A directory for serving static files. In this project, it is used for storing and serving uploaded images. The `ImageService` and `LocalFileStorage` service likely manage files in this directory.

## Frontend (React SPA)

The frontend is a Single-Page Application built using React.

-   **Technology Stack:** JavaScript, React (`create-react-app`), CSS.

### Key Directories:

-   **/src:** Contains all the React components, application logic, and styling for the user interface.
    -   `App.js` is the main application component.
    -   `index.js` is the entry point that renders the React application into the DOM.
-   **/public:** Contains the static assets for the web application, including the main `index.html` file which serves as the shell for the React SPA.

## Communication

The frontend and backend are decoupled and communicate over HTTP.

-   **API Protocol:** The React frontend makes asynchronous requests (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to the .NET Web API endpoints.
-   **Data Format:** Data is exchanged between the client and server primarily in **JSON** format.
